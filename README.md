# Monitoring-using-Prometheus
This documentation is about my networking project focused on  monitoring using Prometheus, Node Exporter, Alertmanager, and Grafana. 

The primary goal of this project is to establish a monitoring system that allows real-time tracking of system metrics, alerting on predefined thresholds, and visualizing data for analysis and decision making.The configuration files used for this purpose all will be ".yml" format.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

1.Prometheus
2.Node exporter
3.Alertmanager
4.Grafana

CONCLUSION

This project successfully implemented a monitoring system using Prometheus, Node Exporter, Alertmanager, and Grafana to monitor the network infrastructure and system health. Prometheus served as the core monitoring tool, collecting and storing time-series data, while Node Exporter gathered detailed node-level metrics. Alertmanager handled alerting and notifications, ensuring timely responses to critical issues. Grafana provided visualization and analysis capabilities, creating informative dashboards for monitoring performance and health metrics.
